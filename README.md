# Encrypting-and-Decrypting-Morse-Code-using-Python-GUI

In this Project I Have described the way of encrypting and decrypting Morse code Using Python(GUI)

Encryption:      
         Encryption is the process by which a readable message is converted to an unreadable form to prevent unauthorized parties from reading it.

Decryption:
            Decryption is the process of converting an encrypted message back to its original (readable) format.

MORSE CODE:
         Morse code is a system of communication developed by Samuel Morse in which letters of the alphabet are coded as a combination of dots and dashes so that messages can either be sent using light, sound or wireless.

Python Libraries Used:
tKinter imported with the alias Tk

APPLICATIONS:

Learning Morse Code: Morse code is still widely used in the field of radio communication, especially in emergency situations. Learning Morse code can be challenging, but with a Python GUI that encrypts and decrypts the code, it can be made much easier.

Sending Secret Messages: Morse code can be used to send secret messages it is easy to encrypt and decrypt. With a Python GUI, you can quickly and easily encrypt your messages and send them to your intended recipient.

Morse Code Practice: If you're learning Morse code, you'll need to practice regularly. A Python GUI that encrypts and decrypts Morse code can be a great tool for practicing your skills.

Accessibility: Morse code can be an important means of communication for people with disabilities, such as those who are deaf or hard of hearing. A Python GUI that encrypts and decrypts Morse code can make it easier for these individuals to communicate with others.

Fun Projects: Finally, encrypting and decrypting Morse code can be a fun project for hobbyists and tinkerers. With a Python GUI, you can experiment with different ways of encrypting and decrypting Morse code and see what creative applications you can produce.
